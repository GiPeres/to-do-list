# to-do-list

The to-do list allows users to add, edit, and delete tasks dynamically using JavaScript. The HTML and CSS provide the structure and styling for the list, while JavaScript handles the user interactions and updates the list accordingly. I also utilized local storage to save the to-do list data, which allows the user's tasks to persist even after they close the browser or refresh the page. This project demonstrates the power of front-end web development technologies in creating dynamic and interactive user interfaces.
